## üíº Professional Experience

<div class="cv-experience-item">

### Capgemini

<div class="cv-company">Total Duration: 1 year 6 months</div>

#### Software Engineer

<div class="cv-duration">September 2024 - Present (1 year 2 months)</div>
<div class="cv-location-detail">Grenoble, Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes, France</div>

Currently working as an apprentice at Capgemini on a large-scale project for a major French public sector client. My role involves developing and maintaining a web application using React.js for the frontend and Laravel (with its ecosystem: Scout, Telescope, etc.) for the backend.

Within a structured V-model cycle, I actively participate in continuous code improvement with a strong focus on quality: unit and integration testing, static analysis via Sonar, rigorous CI/CD with linters and multiple validation stages. I use Jira for task management and regularly contribute to requirements definition by writing tickets that are then validated or refined with the project manager.

This experience allows me to develop a rigorous approach to software development, combining technical excellence, best practices, and methodological monitoring.
